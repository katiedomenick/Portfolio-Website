            <p>"Rose Red" Chapter 1</p>
            
            <p>"Hey there, Beastie."</p>
            
            <p>I turn just in time to see Maddie Oswald's perfect face, scrunched up in a mask of cruelty that only I ever seem to see. To the rest of the world, Maddie Oswald's blonde curls and piercing green eyes are beautiful, innocent, gorgeous.</p>
            
            <p>To me, they are only seen as this. This expression of hatred and smugness all at once.</p>
            
            <p>To me, her 'regular' face looks more like a mask. This is her. The real her.</p>
            
            <p>She slaps the books out of my hands. "So, how's The Beast, Belle?"</p>
            
            <p>My fists clench. "Don't call her that."</p>
            
            <p>She mocks me, her face turning into something like pity, or maybe hope? "Oh, don't worry. She'll only be a monster until her true love comes along."</p>
            
            <p>I stay silent, as she and her minions cackle. I don't even remember doing it. Just pain, in my hand and written across her face.</p>
            
            <p>"YOU-" she lets out a string of curse words, cupping her hand over her nose. Did I punch her?</p>
            
            <p>After a trip to the nurse and the principal's office, the answer seems to be a resounding "yes". I am given detention for two weeks. I try not to look at her after that.</p>
            
            <p>My mom does not want to hear it. "She's doing the same thing that Dad did, you know;" I said angrily. "They're scared of you, of Mila. They do things like this and they get away with it because of the way you both look."</p>
            
            <p>"No, Rosie. They can call us what they want, they will never hurt us." She looked away, but I could see the tears in her eyes. I was only glad that Mila was too young to hear us.</p>
            
            <p>We are direct descendents of Princess Catherine and her family. The original Beauty and the Beast. Hypertrichosis runs in the family. My mother has it. She and my father were told that I had a 50% chance of getting it, and they took that chance, twice.</p>
            
            <p>I was born without the gene. My sister was born with it, Mila. After she was born, our father left. He just...disappeared. We filed a Missing Persons report, but he never came back/ We never heard from him again. Nobody knew for sure what happened, but it wasn't a hard guess.</p>
