    <p>"The City Walls" Chapter 1</p>
    
    <p>This is how my day starts. The sun rises at 6:30 am in the summer, and that means feeding the chickens. I pull on my usual clothing, which consists of a plain shirt and baggy pants, my brown sash cinched around my waist. I braid my hair, which goes halfway down my back. Will used to say it was the color of lightning, or maybe the sun. Joseph says it's the color of white chocolate, a rare treat for us. I dislike the way it tastes. I find it too sweet.
    After I feed the chickens, I usually feed the rest of the animals on the farm, which are not many. We farm crops, for the most part. Grain and tomatoes and peas. Eggs and milk, from the cows. So I collect the eggs and milk the cows in the morning.
    By the time I've done it all, it's nearly eight in the morning, and Mother is making breakfast.
    People say we look alike, but I don't think so. Mother is beautiful, with hair the exact color of corn silk matching her fair skin, complete with wholesome blue eyes. I do not see my freckled, sunburn-flamed cheeks in hers, nor her bright eyes in my murky green ones. I suppose our hair is the same, but that, to me, is where the similarities end. 
    This morning's breakfast is oatmeal, with fresh berries from the blueberry bushes. Usually, we don't spare many berries from our gardens for ourselves, but we have a huge crop coming this year. The berries taste good, and juice floods my tongue as the skin splits between my teeth. 
    Mother isn't around too much anymore, she's been getting Joshua ready for his Choosing. At 16, I had my Choosing more than ten years ago, but Joshua's five, and his Choosing will be next year. Mother is anxious to get him behind the City walls.
    Rose, at eleven, and Luke, at nine, already did their Choosing ceremonies. All that's left is Joshua and Penelope, who's only four. 
    Normally, Father would be doing the morning chores, but it's fallen to me in his absence. He died a few years after Will left. At the young age of twelve, I took on his responsibilities. It would have been Will, but he wasn't there. Mother had to stay in mourning, and though we all knew how hard she tried to help, it was hard not to be angry when she spent days at a time in bed. She still wears her black sash, the one that shows she is a widow. He died of the Green Fever, there was a terrible epidemic that year. He wasn't a sickly man, but when he did got sick, he got really sick. His heart, I think, was bad. We buried him in town, in the town cemetery, with his parents, Father and Mother Brown. All I remember from that day is wondering what we were to be called. Being told that I was still Virginia Brown, but Mother was Stella Feldman now. At least, she would be, when she reclaimed her red sash. That was the worst day of my life. Before that, it was my Choosing Ceremony.
    Will and I were twins, fraternal, of course. We had our Choosing together. 
    We held hands on the stage, hoping and praying that, wherever we would be, we would be there together. 
    I wore my nicest dress, he wore his nicest shirt and pants. Our hair had been combed that morning, and done up nicely.
    When they called out for Will, I tried to follow him, but they wouldn't let me. I screamed, I cried, I kicked at the arms that held me as my brother was dragged away, crying, by an older woman. She was older than Mother. It was horrible. I haven't seen him since.
    I only got one thing. After we came home, Mother collapsed into a chair. Father ushured me out, telling me to take Rose, who was an infant at the time. I remember asking him where Will had gone, and he gave me a name.
    Lillian DuPrees.
